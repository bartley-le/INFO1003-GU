    <p>
        When a stroke occurs, the blood supply to part of the brain is suddenly interrupted. Brain cells die when they no longer receive oxygen and nutrients from the blood or there is sudden bleeding into or around the brain. 
    </p>
    <p>Termed simply as a brain attack and medically as a cerebrovascular mishap, a stroke is a medical condition in which depravation of oxygen is experienced by a portion of the brain. Such a condition can happen if damage is suffered by the artery responsible for supplying blood to the brain. The brain cells cannot live without oxygen and start dying immediately due to the lack of oxygen. The extent of the damage suffered during a stroke increases if the brain is deprived of oxygen for a long period of time. 
    </p>
    <h1>What Happens During a Stroke?</h1>
    <p>Strokes usually occur because of a disruption of blood flow to the brain. This causes death of the brain cells as they do not get the nutrients and oxygen they need to live. If the blood supply is not restored quickly enough, serious or even unrecoverable damage could happen to the brain. What happens during a stroke? The following are some of the indications that say you are having a stroke:
    </p>
    <h4>Unrelenting headache</h4>
    <h4>Unexpected whirling sensation</h4>
    <h4>Fogginess and inability to see clearly</h4>
    <h4>Inability to talk properly</h4>
    <h4>Lack of coordination</h4>
    <h4>Inability to think straight</h4>
    <h4>Unusual deadness or weakness felt over one side of the body</h4>
    
    <p>What happens during a stroke? Damage happens. A stroke can cause permanent damage to a person’s health and can temporarily affect some of his functional capabilities. It all depends on how much brain tissue gets damaged during the oxygen deprivation and also on the side of the brain where it takes place. The common effects that a stroke can have on a person’s body include:
    </p>
    <p>Paralysis is usually a result of stroke where the person loses his ability to use his limbs and starts having difficulty in walking.
    </p>
    <p>Cognitive impairment is another effect of stroke in which the person loses some of his memory and starts having difficulty in concentrating on things.
    </p>
    <p>Depression and loss of control over emotions are common problems faced by stroke patients if the front part of their brain gets damaged during the stroke.   
    </p>
    <p>If the brain’s left hemisphere is damaged, then the patient would find it difficult to speak properly and might even have difficulty in reading and writing as well.
    </p>
    <p>Dysphagia is another effect of stroke which is associated with weakening of the facial muscles and can make it difficult for the patient to eat and swallow.
    </p>
    <p>Perception loss is also a common effect of stroke wherein the person loses his ability to judge distances and thus ends up getting into accidents.
    </p>
