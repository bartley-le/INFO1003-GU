</div>

<div class="container">
    <p>
        There are things you can do to lower your risk of stroke.High blood pressure increases your risk of stroke four to six times.Heart disease, especially a condition known as atrial fibrillation or AF, can double your risk of stroke.Your risk also increases if you smoke, have diabetes, sickle cell disease, high cholesterol, or a family history of stroke. 
    </p>
    <p>A stroke occurs when the blood supply to your brain is interrupted or reduced. This deprives your brain of oxygen and nutrients, which can cause your brain cells to die.
A stroke may be caused by a blocked artery (ischemic stroke) or the leaking or bursting of a blood vessel (hemorrhagic stroke). Some people may experience only a temporary disruption of blood flow to their brain (transient ischemic attack, or TIA).
    </p>
    <h1>Risk factors</h1>
    <p>Many factors can increase your risk of a stroke. Some factors can also increase your chances of having a heart attack. Potentially treatable stroke risk factors include:
    </p>
    <h2>Lifestyle risk factors</h2>
    <p>Being overweight or obese</p>
    <p>Heavy or binge drinking</p>
    <p>Use of illicit drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamines</p>
    <p>Physical inactivity</p>
    <h2>Medical risk factors</h2>
    <p>High blood pressure — the risk of stroke begins to increase at blood pressure readings higher than 120/80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). Your doctor will help you decide on a target blood pressure based on your age, whether you have diabetes and other factors.</p>
    <p>Cigarette smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke</p>
    <p>High cholesterol</p>
    <p>Diabetes</p>
    <p>Obstructive sleep apnea — a sleep disorder in which the oxygen level intermittently drops during the night.</p>
    <p>Cardiovascular disease, including heart failure, heart defects, heart infection or abnormal heart rhythm.</p>
    <h2>Other factors associated with a higher risk of stroke include:</h2>
    <p>Personal or family history of stroke, heart attack or transient ischemic attack.</p>
    <p>Being age 55 or older.</p>
    <p>Race — African-Americans have a higher risk of stroke than do people of other races</p>
    <p>Gender — Men have a higher risk of stroke than women. Women are usually older when they have strokes, and they're more likely to die of strokes than are men. Also, they may have some risk from some birth control pills or hormone therapies that include estrogen, as well as from pregnancy and childbirth.</p>
