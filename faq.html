<!-- Frequently Asked Questions -->
<article class = "FAQ">
         
     <h3>Questions 1. What is Stroke?</h3>
     <p>
	     Answer: The two forms of stroke are ischemic -- blockage of a blood vessel supplying the brain, and hemorrhagic -- bleeding into or around the brain.In an ischemic stroke, a blood clot blocks or plugs a blood vessel or artery in the brain.About 80% of all strokes are ischemic.In a hemorrhagic stroke, a blood vessel in the brain breaks and bleeds into the brain. About 20% of strokes are hemorrhagic. <a href="faq-articles/what-is-stroke.html">Learn more ></a>
	 </p>
	 
	 <h3>Questions 2. What happens during a stroke?</h3>
	 <p>
	     Answer: When a stroke occurs, the blood supply to part of the brain is suddenly interrupted. Brain cells die when they no longer receive oxygen and nutrients from the blood or there is sudden bleeding into or around the brain. <a href="faq-articles/what-happens-during-a-stroke.html">Learn more ></a>
         </p>
	 
	 <h3>Questions 3. What are the key factors for stroke?</h3>
	 <p>
	     Answer: There are things you can do to lower your risk of stroke.High blood pressure increases your risk of stroke four to six times.Heart disease, especially a condition known as atrial fibrillation or AF, can double your risk of stroke.Your risk also increases if you smoke, have diabetes, sickle cell disease, high cholesterol, or a family history of stroke. <a href="faq-articles/key-factors.html">Learn more ></a>
	 </p>
	 
	 <h3>Questions 4. Is there any treatment for stroke?</h3>
	 <p>
	     Answer: Generally there are three treatment stages for stroke: prevention, therapy immediately after the stroke, and post-stroke rehabilitation.Therapies to prevent a first or recurrent stroke are based on treating an individual's underlying risk factors for stroke, such as high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes.Acute stroke therapies try to stop a stroke while it is happening by quickly dissolving the blood clot causing an ischemic stroke or by stopping the bleeding of a hemorrhagic stroke.Post-stroke rehabilitation helps individuals overcome disabilities that result from stroke damage. Medication or drug therapy is the most common treatment for stroke. <a href="faq-articles/treatments.html">Learn more ></a>
	 </p>
	 
	 <h3>Questions 5. What can I do to reduce my risk of stroke?</h3>
	 <p>
	     Answer: To reduce your risk of stroke, monitor your blood pressure, track your cholesterol level, stop smoking, exercise regularly, and find out if you should be taking a drug to reduce blood clotting. <a href="faq-articles/reduce-risk.html">Learn more ></a>
	 </p>
	 
	 <h3>Questions 6. What are the symptoms of a stroke?</h3>
	 <p>
	     Answer: The symptoms of a stroke include sudden numbness or weakness, especially on one side of the body; sudden confusion or trouble speaking or understanding speech; sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes; sudden trouble with walking, dizziness, or loss of balance or coordination; or sudden severe headache with no known cause. <a href="faq-articles/symptoms.html">Learn more ></a>
